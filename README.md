# ECE-650

A simple implementation of the vertex cover problem. Python and C++ were used to construct the logic, and Pipes were used
for inter-process communication. User will provide inputs in the form of edges and
vertices and will get output as a list of vertices via MINISAT library, where cameras
need to be installed.
